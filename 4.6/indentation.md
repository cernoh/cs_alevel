# indenetation

a feature of [[high level language |high level languages]]
represents functions and shows how they work.
Whenever a new selection or iteration  structure begins, the code moves to a higher level of indentation, making  the code easier for humans to understand.

```py
if colour == "red":
	while colour == "red":
		colour = updateColour()
else:
	if colour == "green":
		while colour == "green":
			colour = updateColour()
	else:
		colour = "red"
	
```
