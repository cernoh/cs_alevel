# 4.3.2 Tree Traversal


## 4.3.2.1 Simple tree-traversal algorithm

### Tree-traversal

> Process of visiting/updating/outputting each node in a tree

Form of [[algorithm]]
Unlike [[4.3.1 Graph Traversal]], unique to trees and must start at the root

#### Pre-order Traversal
Used for copying a tree. 
On any tree 

##### Example:
not a [[4.2.5.1 Trees#binary trees|binary tree]]
![[Pasted image 20220116154056.png]]

Start on left hand side of each [[leaf]]
![[Pasted image 20220116154413.png]]

Starts from left and works down the tree
Whenever a blue spot is passed information is outputted

Google is outputted
![[Pasted image 20220116154456.png]]
fox news is outputted


etc until everything is outputted![[Pasted image 20220116154523.png]]
Traversal has then been completed

#### In-Order Traversal
Useful for [[4.2.5.1 Trees#binary trees|binary trees]]
Outputs in ascending order, only performed on binary trees
##### Example

First step is to mark the bottom

Traversal starts from the left and works around the tree. When a blue spot is passed, the node is outputted

etc until all nodes are passed

Traversal has completed

example above is a [binary search tree](binary%20search%20tree.md)

#### Post-order Traversal
Useful for infix to [[4.3.3 Reverse Polish]] conversions

##### Example
![[Pasted image 20220116155618.png]]
Mark right hand side

![[Pasted image 20220116155629.png]]

Starts from left and goes around

![[Pasted image 20220116155647.png]]



etc until all is outputted
