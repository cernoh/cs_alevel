# 4.3.5 Sorting Algorithms
Orders all elements in an [[arrays]]. 
Used to perform binary searches, as they are faster than linear searches
O(logN) < O(N)

Sorted lists reduce time to locate an item.

main ways:
- bubble sort

- merge sort

## Bubble sort
Swapping the position of adjacent items to order them. Time complexity of O($n^2$) , very inefficent.

## Merge sort
orders arrays by splitting them into smaller lists, and then reforming them. Quicker than bubble sort; time complexity of O(nlogn)
