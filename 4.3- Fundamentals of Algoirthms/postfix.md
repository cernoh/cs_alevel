# postfix
[[opcode]] goes after [[Operand]]

## example
$$\Large \text{infix: 3+5}
$$
$$\LARGE \text{postfix:}\space3\space 5\space+$$
both equal 8

### example 2
infix:
$$\LARGE 9 + 6/3$$postfix:
$$\LARGE 9 \space 6\space3\space/\space+$$
in order to calculate, you would do $6/3$ first as they have the first operand close to , then with the product add $9$
