# 4.5.5 Information Coding Systems

## Character form of a decimal digit
To represent characters, match characters to character codes.
Each character code is assigned to a decimal number, for example 

1 for A
2 for B 
3 for C

$$\LARGE Decimal:13 \qquad Binary:1101 \qquad Character:M$$

## ASCII and Unicode
Ascii uses 7 bits to represent 128 different characters
A-Z, a-z, and 0-9

Unicode uses anything from 8-48 bits per character, allowing it to represent a much wider range of different characters than ASCII

## Error checking and correction
prevents chances of incorrect data being transmitted

### parity bits
Single bit added
Calculated based on transmitted data itself

2 types:
- [[even parity]]
- [[odd parity]]

When data is received, parity check is carried out. If received parity bit confirms to type of parity, received data is treated as correct, else asks for data to be re-transmitted.

### Majority voting
Each bit is transmitted multiple times. Most commonly occurring bit taken to be correct
(red is error)

would require as many transmissions as there are bits, but doesn't need multiple transmissions like parity bits.

### Checksums
Involve adding a value to transmitted value
determined by the data itself
No agreed algorithm

**example**

Data sent : $46_{10} = 101110_2$
Value of checksum : $46_{10} MOD 8_{10} = 6_{10} = 110_2$
Data transmitted : $101110110_2$

Recipient can remove checksum and apply same algorithm to ensure checksum matches.

### Check digits
Checksum with only 1 digit added to transmitted algorithm
