# 4.5.5 Information Coding Systems

## Character form of a decimal digit
To represent characters, match characters to character codes.
Each character code is assigned to a decimal number, for example 

1 for A
2 for B 
3 for C

$$\LARGE Decimal:13 \qquad Binary:1101 \qquad Character:M$$

## ASCII and Unicode
Ascii uses 7 bits to represent 128 different characters
A-Z, a-z, and 0-9

Unicode uses anything from 8-48 bits per character, allowing it to represent a much wider range of different characters than ASCII

## Error checking and correction
prevents chances of incorrect data being transmitted
