# 4.5.4 Binary Number System
## 4.5.4.1 unsigned binary
<div  align = 'center'><font size ='7'>  1011 </font></div>
can be signed or unsigned, computer needs to be told what type of number it is.

unsigned is positive. Signed can represent negative numbers. Easily converted 

### range of unsigned numbers
depends on number of bits
Range from  $0$ to $2^{n}-1$

## 4.5.4.2 unsigned binary arithmetic
### adding two unsigned binary integers
remember 4 rules 

1. 0 + 0 + 0 = 0
2. 0 + 0 + 1 = 1
3. 0 + 1 + 1 = 10
4. 1 + 1 + 1 = 11

### multiplying two unsigned binary integers
Write one of the two numbers starting under each occurrence of a 1 in the second number and then add the contents of he columns

## 4.5.4.3 signed binary using two's complement
most significant bit is negative, for example
<div  align = 'center'><font size ='7'> -8 4 2 1 </font></div>
<div  align = 'center'><font size ='7'>   1  0  1  1 </font></div>
so -5 is represented by 1011
### subtraction using twos compliment
add negative numbers
