# 4.2.6.1 Hash tables

method of storing data
allows data to be retrieved with a time complexity of O(1)
Hashing algorithm takes an input and returns a hash. A hash is unique to its input and cannot be reversed to retrieve the input value.

example:

If input was 10, hash would be 1.

Hash table stores values alongside a key. 
when value is inserted:
- value hashed to produce a key
- value is then stored in the table alongside its key

when a value is to be looked up :
1) its hashed
2) position in the table corresponding to that has is queried
3) desired information is located

[[collision]]

to get around that, some use [[rehashing]]
