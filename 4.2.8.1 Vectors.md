# 4.2.8.1 Vectors
Can be represented as lists of numbers, functions or ways of representing a point in space.

As a list of numbers : [12, 7, 3 ,55]
As a vector space over a field : 4-vector over ℤ ($ℤ^{4}$)
As a function : ![[Pasted image 20211114144311.png]]
As a point in space: { 12 , 7 , 3, 55}

If viewed as a function, a vector can be represented by using a [[4.2.7.1 Dictionaries|dictionary]] . If viewed as a list, a [[4.2.1.2 Single and multi-dimensional arrays#single dimensional arrays|one dimensional array would be suitable]]

Can be represented by an arrow. For example, [14,4 ] can be represented with this arrow:

## vector addition
can be added to achieve translation. With arrows, vectors are added tip to tail
