# 4.2.8.1 Vectors
Can be represented as lists of numbers, functions or ways of representing a point in space.

As a list of numbers : [12, 7, 3 ,55]
As a vector space over a field : 4-vector over ℤ ($ℤ^{4}$)
As a function : ![[Pasted image 20211114144311.png]]
As a point in space: { 12 , 7 , 3, 55}

If viewed as a function, a vector can be represented by using a [[4.2.7.1 Dictionaries|dictionary]] . If viewed as a list, a [[4.2.1.2 Single and multi-dimensional arrays#single dimensional arrays|one dimensional array would be suitable]]

Can be represented by an arrow. For example, [14,4 ] can be represented with this arrow:

## vector addition
can be added to achieve translation. With arrows, vectors are added tip to tail.

alternatively , vectors can be added algebraically :

## scalar-vector multiplication
in order to scale a vector, each of its components are multiplied by a scalar.

only affects magnitude, not direction.

## convex combination of two vectors
If you have 2 vectors, `a` and `b`, then a convex combination of the two would be `ax + by` , where x and y are both non zero numbers less than one that add to 1.


for example , let a be the vector [1,1] and b be the vector [2,4]

let's choose x and y to be 0.8 and 0.2 respectively. Neither are 0 and they add to 1.

now we can form a convex combination of a and b as follows

## dot product
Also known as the scalar product

single number derived from the components of the vectors that can be used to determined the angle between two vectors.

dot product of the vectors `a = [12,3]` and `b = [5,8]` is notated $a \cdot b$
