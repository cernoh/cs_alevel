# 4.7.1 Internal hardware components of a computer

## Components
### the processor
Executes program instructions to run applications

related :[[4.7.3 Structre and role of the processor and its components]]

### Main memory
Includes [[RAM]] and [[ROM]]

### buses
Series of parallel wires
Connects internal components of a computer
no. of parallel wires called its width 
[[parallel data transmission]]

3 Important buses:
- Address
- Data
- Control

#### Address
Used to transport memory addresses, specifying where data is to be sent to or retrieved from 
Increasing width increases range of addresses that can be specified, therefore increasing computers amount of addressable memory

| Number of parallel wires in address bus | Number of addressable memory locations |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| 1                                       | $2^1 = 2$                              |
| 2                                       | $2^2 = 4$                                       |
| 3                                       |         $2^3=8$                               |

#### Data
Sends data and instructions
To and from various components
Increasing width increases volume of data

#### control
Carrry out control signals
Regulates operation of compmuter
Carries clock signal

### I/O controllers
Controls communication of data
between [[4.7.4 External hardware devices]] and processor

## Von Neumann and Harvard architectures
Processor to main memory

### Harvard
Processor uses two separate main memory locations
1 for instructions 1 for data

Advantage : each piece of main memory had different characteristics, So instructional memory can be read only.

Used for embedded systems

### Von neumann architecture
Both instructions and data are stored together in same memory
Perform worse than Harvard architecture
Same buses have to be shared for fetching both instructions and data
Used in every day general purpose computer systems like laptops and smartphones
