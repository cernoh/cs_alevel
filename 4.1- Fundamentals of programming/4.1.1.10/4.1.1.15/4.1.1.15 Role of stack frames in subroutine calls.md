# The role of stack frames in subroutine calls
Stack frames are used by computers to store return addresses, parameters and local variables for each subroutine call that occurs during the execution of a program. 

### notes
if one subroutine calls to another, [[Nested Structures|nesting]] is said to occur. 

If one subroutine calls another, nesting is said to occur. Each subroutine call will be  
pushed onto the computer’s call stack in the form of a stack frame before the subroutine’s  code begins to execute. When the nested subroutine finishes executing, the stack frame is popped from the call stack and the computer uses the information to return to execution of the previous subroutine.

#### Stack Frame Example
When the pseudocode above is run, the subroutine `getTimeOfDay` is called from within
the subroutine Greeting and nesting occurs. 

The first stack frame to be pushed onto the call stack is for the subroutine `Greeting`

When the subroutine `GetTimeOfDay` is called, another stack frame is pushed onto the call stack and is placed on top of the frame representing `Greeting`

when the subroutine `GetTimeOfDay` completes, its corresponding stack frame is popped from the call stack.

the computer now takes the stack frame at the top of the stack and goes to the specified reutrn address. Any parameters and locals variables are restored.

Once the subroutine `Greeting` has completed, the final stack frame is popped from the call stack, leaving it empty.
