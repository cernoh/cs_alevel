# Constant
you **cannot** change the value of a constant during the runtime of the program


### example
`const text = "hello"`

### notes
- Used for storing data that doesn't need to change such as the value for pi or the number of days in a year. 
- lets values be given identifier names which makes code easier for a human to understand.
- if a constant is used in mutliple places, it makes it easier to update as you jsut have to change it in one place.
