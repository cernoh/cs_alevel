# 4.2.1.4 Abstract data types/ data structures
Don't exist as data structures in their own right, instead they make use of other data structures such as arrays to form a new way of storing data.

## Queues
Based on an array 
First item added is the first to be removed
known as First in, First out / FIFO abstract data structures
Used by computers in keyboard buffers,  where each key-press is added to the queue then removed when the computer processes the key-press. 
Breadth first search algorithm is used.

main operations are:

| name          | description                              |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| enqueue(data) | adds an element to the queue             |
| dequeue()     | returns element in front, and removes it |
| is_empty()    | checks if queue is empty                 |
| is_full()     | checks if queue is full                  |

### Linear queues
has two pointers, a front pointer and a rear pointer.
Can identify where to place a new item in a queue or to identify which item is at the front of the queue.

This shows a queue with 5 positions, two of which are occupied.
