# 4.2.1.4 Abstract data types/ data structures
Don't exist as data structures in their own right, instead they make use of other data structures such as arrays to form a new way of storing data.

## Queues
Based on an array 
First item added is the first to be removed
known as First in, First out / FIFO abstract data structures
Used by computers in keyboard buffers,  where each key-press is added to the queue then removed when the computer processes the key-press. 
Breadth first search algorithm is used.

main operations are:

| name          | description                              |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| enqueue(data) | adds an element to the queue             |
| dequeue()     | returns element in front, and removes it |
| is_empty()    | checks if queue is empty                 |
| is_full()     | checks if queue is full                  |

### Linear queues
has two pointers, a front pointer and a rear pointer.
Can identify where to place a new item in a queue or to identify which item is at the front of the queue.

This shows a queue with 5 positions, two of which are occupied. Since Emma is at the front, she mustve been enqueued before Justin, who's at the back. The rear pointer always points at the next available position

If we perform the operation `Queue.Enqueue("Zhang")`, it would look like this:

Then if we were to use `Queue.dequeue()`, `Emma` would be returned and the queue will now look like this:

### Circular queues
Type of queue in which the front and rear pointers can move over the two ends of the queue, making it more memory efficient

if we perform the operation `Queue.Enqueue("Hans")`, the rear pointer jumps to the left hand side of the queue.

Now we can use the operation `Queue.Enqueue("James")`. This would not be possible with a linear
