# 4.2.1.4 Abstract data types/ data structures
Don't exist as data structures in their own right, instead they make use of other data structures such as arrays to form a new way of storing data.

## Queues
Based on an array 
First item added is the first to be removed
known as First in, First out / FIFO abstract data structures
Used by computers in keyboard buffers,  where each key-press is added to the queue then removed when the computer processes the key-press. 
Breadth first search algorithm is used.
