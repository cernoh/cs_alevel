# 4.2.1.4 Abstract data types/ data structures
Don't exist as data structures in their own right, instead they make use of other data structures such as arrays to form a new way of storing data.

## Queues
Based on an array 
First item added is the first to be removed
known as First in, First out / FIFO abstract data structures
Used by computers in keyboard buffers,  where each key-press is added to the queue then removed when the computer processes the key-press. 
Breadth first search algorithm is used.

main operations are:

| name          | description                              |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| enqueue(data) | adds an element to the queue             |
| dequeue()     | returns element in front, and removes it |
| is_empty()    | checks if queue is empty                 |
| is_full()     | checks if queue is full                  |

### Linear queues
has two pointers, a front pointer and a rear pointer.
Can identify where to place a new item in a queue or to identify which item is at the front of the queue.

This shows a queue with 5 positions, two of which are occupied. Since Emma is at the front, she mustve been enqueued before Justin, who's at the back. The rear pointer always points at the next available position

If we perform the operation `Queue.Enqueue("Zhang")`, it would look like this:

Then if we were to use `Queue.dequeue()`, `Emma` would be returned and the queue will now look like this:

### Circular queues
Type of queue in which the front and rear pointers can move over the two ends of the queue, making it more memory efficient

![[Pasted image 20211113180427.png]]

if we perform the operation `Queue.Enqueue("Hans")`, the rear pointer jumps to the left hand side of the queue.

Now we can use the operation `Queue.Enqueue("James")`. This would not be possible with a linear queue, as there were no available space behind the front pointer. 
A circular queue can circumvent that by the rear pointer jumping over the ends of the queue and making use of available spaces before the front pointer

Queue continues to work as before, dequeuing items from the position specified by the front pointer. If the operation `Queue.Dequeue()` were performed now, Sarah would be removed

### Priority queue
Items are assigned a priority. Items with the highest priority are dequeued before low priority items. 

If two items have the same priority, the items are removed in the FIFO order.

Usually used in computer systems, for example processors.

## stacks
First in, Last out (FILO) abstract data structure

Only have one pointer, a top pointer.

Main operations are:

| Names      | Description                                           |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| push(data) | adds an element to the top of the stack               |
| pop()      | removes an element from the top of the stack          |
| peek()     | returns a copy of the top element without removing it |
| is_empty() | same as queue                                         |
| is_full()  | same as queue when stored in a static structure       |

**example:**
![[Pasted image 20211113184614.png]]
- this stack contains 3 names. Bruce is at the top of the stack as indicated by the position of the top pointer.
- Mary is at the bottom of the stack, which must mean that Mary has been in thee stack for the longest.
- `Stack.Peek()` returns "Bruce" 

![[Pasted image 20211113184827.png]]

- The top diagram shows the state of the stack after operation `Stack.Push("Charlie")`
- Executing the operation `Stack.Pop` at this stage would remove Charlie from the stack and move the top pointer down one position to Bruce.
- The pop operation can be used to assign variables and constants. For example, the operation `x ‚Üê Stack` . Pop would assign the value "Charlie" to the variable x. This is also applicable to the peek function.

![[Pasted image 20211113185302.png]]

- The diagram on the left shows the state of the stack after the operation `Stack.Push ("Maria")`
- Maria is now at the top of the stack and there are no available spaces above the top pointer.
- If a push command was executed now, an error would be returned. This error is called a [[stack overflow]]
- A similar error , called a stack underflow, can be caused by attempting the pop command on an empty stack.

## Graphs
Used to represent complex relationships between items within datasets. Graphs acn be used to represent networks such as transport networks, IT networks and the [[Internet]]

A graph consists of nodes/vertices, which are joined by edges/arcs. A weighted graph is one in which edges are assigned a value, representing a value such as time, distance, or cost.

### adjacency matrices

A tabular representation of a graph. Each of the nodes in the graph is assigned both a row and a column in the table.
