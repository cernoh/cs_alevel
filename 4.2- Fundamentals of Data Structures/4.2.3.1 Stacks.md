# 4.2.3.1 Stacks
First in, Last out (FILO) abstract data structure

Only have one pointer, a top pointer.

Main operations are:

| Names      | Description                                           |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| push(data) | adds an element to the top of the stack               |
| pop()      | removes an element from the top of the stack          |
| peek()     | returns a copy of the top element without removing it |
| is_empty() | same as queue                                         |
| is_full()  | same as queue when stored in a static structure       |

**example:**
![[Pasted image 20211113184614.png]]
- this stack contains 3 names. Bruce is at the top of the stack as indicated by the position of the top pointer.
- Mary is at the bottom of the stack, which must mean that Mary has been in thee stack for the longest.
- `Stack.Peek()` returns "Bruce"

- The top diagram shows the state of the stack after operation `Stack.Push("Charlie")`
- Executing the operation `Stack.Pop` at this stage would remove Charlie from the stack and move the top pointer down one position to Bruce.
- The pop operation can be used to assign variables and constants. For example, the operation `x ‚Üê Stack` . Pop would assign the value "Charlie" to the variable x. This is also applicable to the peek function.

- The diagram on the left shows the state of the stack after the operation `Stack.Push ("Maria")`
- Maria is now at the top of the stack and there are no available spaces above the top pointer.
- If a push command was executed now, an error would be returned. This error is called a [[stack overflow]]
- A similar error , called a stack underflow, can be caused by attempting the pop command on an empty stack.
