# 4.2.4.1 Graphs
Used to represent complex relationships between items within datasets. Graphs can be used to represent networks such as transport networks, IT networks and the [[Internet]]

A graph consists of nodes/vertices, which are joined by edges/arcs. A weighted graph is one in which edges are assigned a value, representing a value such as time, distance, or cost.

## adjacency matrices

A tabular representation of a graph. Each of the nodes in the graph is assigned both a row and a column in the table.

| A 1 is used to show that an edge exists between two nodes and a 0 shows that there is no connection                                                 | Rather than using Boolean values, adjacency matrices for weighted graphs contain the weight of a connection between two nodes           |
| Notice that adjacency matrices have a characteristic diagonal line of 0s (shown in blue) where the row and column represent the same node.          | It no connection exist, an arbitrarily large value is used. These will prevent any shortest path algorithm from using non existent edges |
| Note also that adjacency matrices display diagonal symmetry, as shown by the green cells which are a reflection of the white cells in the blue line |                                                                                                                                         |


## adjacency lists
Rather than using a table, a list can be used.

For each node in the graph , a list of adjacent nodes is created. This means that an adjacency list only records existing connections in a graph, unlike an adjacency matrix which stores even those edges that don't exist.
