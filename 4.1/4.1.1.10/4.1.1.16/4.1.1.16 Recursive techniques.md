# Recursive techniques
Defined in terms of itself. That means somewhere in the recursive subroutine, there's a call to the subroutine itself. 

Any recursive subroutine must have a stopping condition (called a [[base case]]) which must be met at some point in the execution of the program.

If an algorithm calls itself, it doesn't have a base case, it will never terminate. This will cause a [[stack overflow]] as more and more stack frames are pushed onto the call stack. 

### example
```
SUBROUTINE Factorial(Value)
	IF Value = 0 THEN
		RETURN 1
	ELSE
		RETURN Value * Factorial(Value - 1)
	ENDIF
END SUBROUTINE
```
the algorithm can be called recursive because it calls itself on line 5.
