## rooted trees
Has a root node from which all other nodes stem. The root node is usually at the top of the tree.

Nodes from which other nodes stem are called parent nodes. The root node is the only node in a rooted tree with no parent. Nodes with a parent are called *child nodes* and child nodes with no children are called *leaf nodes *
